  description: `I‚Äôm a passionate frontend developer with 3 years of experience, specializing in React.js, WordPress, and Shopify. I focus on crafting modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites that deliver seamless digital experiences. Clean code, performance, and design consistency are always at the core of my work.

I began my journey in web development 3 years ago, and since then I‚Äôve been building and customizing websites, themes, and applications across diverse projects. With strong skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I create interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also functional and optimized for performance.

I enjoy working on projects end to end ‚Äî from brainstorming ideas to building and deploying complete solutions. Whether it‚Äôs creating a custom Shopify storefront, developing a WordPress website, or building dynamic React applications, I love bringing ideas to life through code.

When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll often find me exploring new tools, learning the latest frontend technologies, or gaining inspiration from the design and startup community.`,
